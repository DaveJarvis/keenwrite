Listing English contractions helps converting straight apostrophes into curly apostrophes. The files include:

* began.txt -- Contractions that begin with an apostrophe.
* ended.txt -- Contractions that end with an apostrophe.
* inner.txt -- Contractions that have internal apostrophes.
* outer.txt -- Contractions that start and end with an apostrophe.
* verbs.txt -- Contractions that form suffixes for a variety of words.

The contractions for verbs must be detected dynamically.
