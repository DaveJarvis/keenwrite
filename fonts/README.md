# Fonts

For best results, it is recommended that the Noto Font family is installed
on the system. The required font families include:

* Sans-serif --- editor pane
* Sans-serif monospace --- editor pane
* Serif --- preview pane
* Serif monospace --- preview pane

# Chinese, Japanese, and Korean (CJK)

Download and install from the following font bundles:

* [Hong Kong](noto-hk.zip)
* [Japanese](noto-jp.zip)
* [Korean](noto-kr.zip)
* [Simplified Chinese](noto-sc.zip)
* [Traditional Chinese](noto-tc.zip)

Except for Hong Kong, each bundle contains all the required font families;
Hong Kong must be paired with the Simplified Chinese.

The [official versions](https://www.google.com/get/noto/) of these fonts
are updated regularly at the Noto Fonts
[repository](https://github.com/googlefonts/noto-fonts/). If downloading
from the original location, be sure to retrieve all four versions needed
for the application to render text correctly.

# Internationalization

Fonts for other languages may work but have not been tested.
